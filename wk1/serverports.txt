Server Ports - Questions and Answers

1. What is the definition of server port?
A server port is a logical endpoint for network communication that identifies a specific process
or service running on a server. It is a 16-bit number used by transport layer protocols (TCP and UDP)
to direct incoming traffic to the appropriate application or service on a computer.

2. What is server port range?
Server ports (also called well-known ports or system ports) range from 0 to 1023.
These ports are reserved for common, well-established services and
typically require administrator or root privileges to bind to them.

3. How many bits does number above represent?
The server port range (0-1023) can be represented using 10 bits,
since 2^10 = 1024 possible values (0 to 1023).
